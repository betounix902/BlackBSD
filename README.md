Organization
The project has a Core Team, similar to the other various BSD projects. We are currently seeking contributors for all aspects of the project, and additions to the Core Team will be chosen from the most active contributors. One of the initial Core Team's first action items is to establish the rules for how future Core Team and project members will be selected.

Contributing
The BlackBSD project is always looking for talented individuals to contribute to and join the project.
